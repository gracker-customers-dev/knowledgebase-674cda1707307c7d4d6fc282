Include relevant keywords in your image alt text to improve visibility in image search results. For example, use \"red leather handbag\" rather than just \"handbag\" as alt text.\n### File Names\nOptimize your image file names by using descriptive, keyword-rich phrases. Instead of \"IMG1234.jpg,\" use \"red-leather-handbag.jpg\" to help search engines understand the content of your images.",
